# üìä CRM Analytics: Unlocking Customer Insights with Data

## Overview
This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of customer purchasing behavior using CRM Analytics. 
By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), RFM segmentation, Cohort analysis, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimation, and visualization techniques, we uncover valuable insights to optimize business strategies.

## Dataset: E-Commerce Transactions
We utilize real-world e-commerce transaction data sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
This dataset includes actual transactions from a UK-based online retailer between December 2010 and December 2011, primarily selling unique gift items.

### Dataset Features

- **InvoiceNo:** Unique transaction identifier (cancellations marked with 'C').
- **StockCode:** Unique product identifier.
- **Description:** Name of the product.
- **Quantity:** Number of items purchased per transaction.
- **InvoiceDate:** Timestamp of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice:** Price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID:** Unique customer identifier.
- **Country:** Country of the customer.
